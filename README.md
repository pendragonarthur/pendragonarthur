👋 Hi, I’m @pendragonarthur, also known as Arthur or Tuzin (translated literally as Lil Tuzi).

I'm 20 years old (until november 9), Brazilian 🇧🇷, certified geek and nerd, but I'm also unmeasurably cool and funny 🤠. I've started coding last year, so I'm actually 
a begginer in this area but I learn quickly almost everything. My goal here is to build a carreer and get closer and closer to my main goal. ✨

I watch animes and play a lot of video-games 🎮 (top 3 🥇 Skyrim, 🥈 Resident Evil Village and 🥉The Witcher 3). I have a dog 🐕, her name is Melina, she's a shi-tzu
and she is the sweetest thing of all things ever to exist. Yes, I love cats but my mother doesn't let me adopt one. 

Ok, now my interests relationed to coding:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Flutter
- Python
- And basically all the front-end stuff. 

My first language is Portugues and I am fluent in English. 

Well, that's me. 👍
